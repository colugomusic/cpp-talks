These are manually sorted by a vague criteria of relevance + value but don't read too much into the order. If a channel is listed here at all then it's because I think it's at least interesting enough to be listed.

Some of these are yearly conferences, some of them have no predictable upload schedule. Some of them are dead but the channel still has good/relevant videos on it. If you want to have a fairly steady stream of incoming talks to check out then subscribe to all of them and never be not-bored again.
